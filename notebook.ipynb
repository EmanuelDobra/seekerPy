What is to be negated is not personal self or one’s existence\\nas a rational and responsible human being. Jesus does not plan to turn us\\ninto zombies, nor does he ask us to volunteer for a robot role. The required\\ndenial is of carnal self, the egocentric, self-deifying urge with which we were\\nborn and which dominates us so ruinously in our natural state. Jesus links\\nself-denial with cross-bearing. Cross-bearing is far more than enduring this\\nor that hardship. Carrying one’s cross in Jesus’ day , as we learn from the\\nstory of Jesus’ own crucifixion, was required of those whom society had\\ncondemned, whose rights were forfeit, and who were now being led out to their\\nexecution. The cross they carried was the instrument of death. Jesus represents\\ndiscipleship as a matter of following him, and following him as based on taking\\nup one’s cross in self-negation. Carnal self would never consent to cast us in\\nsuch a role. ”When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die,” wrote\\nDietrich Bonhoeffer. Bonhoeffer was right: Accepting death to everything that\\ncarnal self wants to possess is what Christ’s summons to self-denial was all\\nabout.\\nJ.I. PackerJ.I.
