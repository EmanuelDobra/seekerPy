Assuming that it is possible for a man to be self-indulgent\\nand yet heaven-bound, Bible teachers look for some way to bring ego-centric\\nmen to a higher spiritual plane.

Self-denial is a summons to submit to the authority\\nof God as F ather and of Jesus as Lord and to declare lifelong war on one’s\\ninstinctive egoism. What is to be negated is not personal self or one’s existence\\nas a rational and responsible human being. Jesus does not plan to turn us\\ninto zombies, nor does he ask us to volunteer for a robot role. The required\\ndenial is of carnal self, the egocentric, self-deifying urge with which we were\\nborn and which dominates us so ruinously in our natural state. Jesus links\\nself-denial with cross-bearing. Cross-bearing is far more than enduring this\\nor that hardship. Carrying one’s cross in Jesus’ day , as we learn from the\\nstory of Jesus’ own crucifixion, was required of those whom society had\\ncondemned, whose rights were forfeit, and who were now being led out to their\\nexecution. The cross they carried was the instrument of death. Jesus represents\\ndiscipleship as a matter of following him, and following him as based on taking\\nup one’s cross in self-negation. Carnal self would never consent to cast us in\\nsuch a role. ”When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die,” wrote\\nDietrich Bonhoeffer.

Next\\nto communion with God, there is no communion like the communion of saints. ”\\n-GEORGE SWINNOCK\\n”Examples do strangely charm us into imitation. When holiness is pressed upon\\nus we are prone to think that it is a doctrine calculated for angels and spirits\\nwhose dwelling is not with flesh. But when we read the lives of them that\\nexcelled in holiness, though they were persons of like passions with ourselves,\\nthe conviction is wonderful and powerful. ” -COTTON MA THER\\n”What was it that obliged Jerome to write his book, Concerning Illustrious Men?\\nIt was the common reproach of old cast upon Christians, ’That they were all\\npoor, weak, unlearned men. ’ The sort of men sometime called ’Puritans’ in the\\nEnglish nation have been reproached with the same character. . . But when\\ntruth shall have liberty to speak, it will be known that Christianity never was\\nmore expressed unto the life than in the lives of the persons that have been thus\\nreproached. ” -COTTON MA THER\\n”I have often thought of Mr Paul Bayne, his fairwell words to Dr Ames when\\ngoing to Holland; Mr Bayne perceiving him to be a man of extra-ordinary parts,\\n’Beware (said he) of a strong head and a cold heart. ’” -COTTON MA THER\\n”Y ou all have by you a large treasure of divine knowledge, in that you have the\\nBible in your hands; therefore be not contented in possessing but little of this\\ntreasure. God hath spoken much to you in the Scripture; labor to understand as\\nmuch of what he saith as you can. God hath made you all reasonable creatures;\\ntherefore let not the noble faculty of reason or understanding lie neglected. Con-\\ntent not yourselves with having so much knowledge as is thrown in your way ,\\nand as you receive in some sense unavoidably by the frequent inculcation of\\ndivine truth in the preaching of the word, of which you are obliged to be hear-\\ners, or as you accidentally gain in conversation; but let it be very much your\\n50'),\n",

God aims at satisfying justice in\\nthe eternal damnation of sinners; which will be satisfied by their damnation,\\nconsidered no otherwise than with regard to its eternal duration. But yet there\\nnever will come that particular moment, when it can be said, that now justice\\nis satisfied. But if this does not satisfy our modern free-thinkers who do not like\\nto talk about satisfying justice with an infinite punishment; I suppose it will\\nnot be denied by any , that God, in glorifying the saints in heaven with eternal\\nfelicity , aims to satisfy his infinite grace or benevolence, by the bestowment of\\na good infinitely valuable, because eternal: and yet there never will come that\\nmoment, when it can be said, that now this infinitely valuable good has been\\nactually bestowed. ” -JONA THAN EDW ARDS\\n”Do you not find yourselves forgetful of Jesus? Some creature steals away your\\nheart, and you are unmindful of him upon whom your affection ought to be\\nset. Some earthly business engrosses your attention when you should have your\\neye steadily fixed upon the cross. It is the incessant round of world, world,\\nworld; the constant din of earth, earth, earth, that takes away the soul from\\nChrist. Oh! my friends, is it not too sadly true that we can recollect anything\\nbut Christ, and forget nothing so easy as him whom we ought to remember?\\nWhile memory will preserve a poisoned weed, it suffereth the Rose of Sharon to\\nwither. ” -C.H. Spurgeon\\n”The reason [for the spread of Arminian] doctrine is because some preachers are\\nmen of learning and moral men, and they have drunk in some errors and lack\\nexperience. Learning and morality will qualify men to make many good and\\nprofitable sermons, much for the edification of the hearers. Learning qualifies\\nmen to clear up many principles of religion, and a moral disposition may fit men\\nzealously to reprove vicious practices. But men may be learned men, yet drink\\nin very corrupt doctrines. ” -SOLOMON STODDARD\\n”Remember the perfections of that God whom you worship, that he is a Spirit,\\nand therefore to be worshipped in spirit and truth; and that he is most great\\nand terrible, and therefore to be worshipped with seriousness and reverence,\\nand not to be dallied with, or served with toys or lifeless lip-service; and that\\nhe is most holy , pure, and jealous, and therefore to be purely worshipped; and\\nthat he is still present with you, and all things are naked and open to him with\\nwhom we have to do. The knowledge of God, and the remembrance of his all-\\nseeing presence, are the most powerful means against hypocrisy . ” -RICHARD\\nBAXTER\\n”Most of God’s people are contented to be saved from the hell that is without;\\nthey are not so anxious to be saved from the hell that is within. ” -ROBER T\\nMURRA Y MCCHEYNE\\n51'),\n",

The true original and prime motive of all\\ngracious, bountiful expressions and effusions of love upon his elect, is the good\\npleasure of his will. And therefore to hold that election to life is made upon\\nforesight of faith, good works the right use of free will, or any created motive, is\\nnot only false and wicked, but also ignorant and absurd tenet.
